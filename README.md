### 002 | 5/9/2022 - Monday

My idea for a game:

- Reverse tower defense

- Possible player gets a single character with 1000 respawns.

- Would like multiplayer with players getting their equipment and reinforcements??

- Tower is boss

- Waves are players

Maybe change to be like wirebugs from Monster Hunter Rise.

The "enemy" throws out wires to the main object

Original repo being hidden and a new one for dev-log will be created.

Continuing with the web-page a day challenge. This is my own deal where I take an example from the previously mentioned Twitter post.

### 008 | 5/25/2022 - Wednesday

I've been doing this for awhile now. This is my 8th entry into the README.md file.

I did not complete a web-page a day however I am continuing to move forward. I need a spell checker for VSCode.

When to use img tag vs background-image :

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492809/when-to-use-img-vs-css-background-image

In essence the idea is background-image is used for non-essential images. Use img to convey meaning(with a tag) behind warning signs and other accessibility methods. 


Starting flex container fun
