My idea for a game:

- Reverse tower defense

- Possible player gets a single character with 1000 respawns.

- Would like multiplayer with players getting their equipment and reinforcements??

- Tower is boss

- Waves are players

Maybe change to be like wirebugs from Monster Hunter Rise.

The "enemy" throws out wires to the main object
