### 002 | 5/9/2022 - Monday

My idea for a game:

- Reverse tower defense

- Possible player gets a single character with 1000 respawns.

- Would like multiplayer with players getting their equipment and reinforcements??

- Tower is boss

- Waves are players

Maybe change to be like wirebugs from Monster Hunter Rise.

The "enemy" throws out wires to the main object

### 004 | 5/18/2022 - Wednesday

Reworking this markdown file into #100DaysOfCode folder.. again.

Original repo being hidden and a new one for dev-log will be created.

### 006 | 5/20/2022 - Friday

Continuing with the web-page a day challenge. This is my own deal where I take an example from the previously mentioned Twitter post.

### 007 | 5/21/2022 - Saturday

### 008 | 5/25/2022 - Wednesday

I've been doing this for awhile now. This is my 8th entry into the README.md file.

I did not complete a web-page a day however I am continuing to move forward. I need a spell checker for VSCode.

When to use img tag vs background-image :

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492809/when-to-use-img-vs-css-background-image

In essence the idea is background-image is used for non-essential images. Use img to convey meaning(with a tag) behind warning signs and other accessibility methods. 


Starting flex container fun.

- nav-bar-04 is using :

    - https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-responsive-navigation-bar-with-flexbox--cms-33535

    - [Before and After psuedo elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoRbkm8XgfQ)



- create script that puts the fetch method first and you enter [name] [api]

- https://getwaves.io/


- nav-bar-03 became quotes-02

### 009 | 5/31/2022 - Tuesday

Decided to do Pokemon drawings in CSS. Learning alot about border raidus. The idea is to make a vector image using CSS shapes only. This is tougher than I previously thought. So far I'm struggling with the concept of having straight edges and curved edges. I might need to mess around with the "transform: skew();" method.

### 010 | 6/1/2022 - Wednesday

Today I don't really know what I want to do. Probably more CSS until I figure out the shapes and stuff.

I want to build some javascript stuff. My only issue is finding out what I want to build. Most of the things I think of are API based.
